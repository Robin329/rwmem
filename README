== rwmem - A small tool to read/write memory ==

rwmem is a small tool to read and write arbitrary locations in a file.
Normally, this file is /dev/mem, so the tool reads/writes memory, but the file
can be anything.

rwmem supports accessing 64 bit addresses, and accessing 8/16/32/64 bit memory
locations.

rwmem also supports bitfields, i.e. accessing only a subset of the memory
location.

When writing a value, by default rwmem will read the current value, and, if
bitfield operation is used, modify the value. By specifying -w option, rwmem
will not read the memory, only write to it.

== Usage ==

usage: rwmem [-s <size>] [-f file] [-w] <address>[:h[:l]] [value]
	-s		size of the memory access: 8/16/32/64 (default: 32)
	-f		file to open (default: /dev/mem)
	-w		write only mode
	<address>	address to access
	h		field's high bit number (inclusive, start from 0)
	l		field's low bit number (inclusive, start from 0)
	<value>		value to be written

== Examples ==

Show what's in memory location 0x12345678

	$ ./rwmem 0x12345678

Show what's in memory location 0x12345678's bit 7 (i.e. 8th bit)

	$ ./rwmem 0x12345678:7

Write 0xbaadf00d to memory location 0x12345678

	$ ./rwmem 0x12345678 0xbaadf00d

Modify memory location 0x12345678's bits 4,5,6 and 7 to 0xf

	$ ./rwmem 0x12345678 0xbaadf00d:7:4 0xf
