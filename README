== rwmem - A small tool to read/write memory ==

rwmem is a small tool to read and write arbitrary locations in memory. rwmem
uses /dev/mem to access the memory. It supports accessing 8/16/32/64 bit memory
locations, and bitfield operations.

== Usage ==

rwmem <mode> <regsize> <address>[:h[:l]] [value]

mode            r/w/rw
regsize         8/16/32/64
address         memory address
h               field's high bit number
l               field's low bit number
value           value to be written
